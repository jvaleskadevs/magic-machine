This repo contains a Foundry project with the smart contracts of the Magic Machine and the frame to interact with these smart contracts from the farcaster decentralized network.

A machine for random distribution of previously curated artworks imitating the behaviour of a vending machine.

The owner curates and loads the machine with nfts, erc1155 and erc721 supported, calling the deposit and loadMachine functions in the smart contract,
then, these artworks are randomly distributes to collectors who interacts with the farcaster frame of the Magic Machine.


## What is the Magic Machine?

The Magic Machine aims to solve some of the most important problems in the current onchain art scene. Helping artists and users in the same time. With the focus on discovering, curation and distribution, the Magic Machine provides artists with a way to distribute their artworks to a selected audience and collectors with new high quality artworks in a couple of clicks.


#### Creators flow 
- Create.
- Send artwork to the machine.
- Enjoy.

#### Collectors flow 
- Click the "Find Art" button in the machine frame.
- Choose a chain and a payment method. Confirm.
- Get random high quality artworks in their wallets.

## What does means for creators and collectors?

We provide artists a new way to increase their exposure with no effort through our innovative system of distribution and we also are in charge of curating the artworks providing our users only high quality artworks saving tons of gold (time) for all of them. 

For creators this means that they can focus on creating high quality art while the Magic Machine is in charge of randomly distributing it to a selected audience in the Farcaster network. Freeing them of the struggle to fight againts others artists for a bit of attention. With the Magic Machine, the attention of collectors is fairly distributed between all the artists and artworks contributing to the protocol ensuring that all of them remains visible to collectors.

Currently collectors have to spend their attention, time and effort, scrolling through tons of low effort art. With the Magic Machine, collectors only need about 1 minute to discover and collect 3 new high quality artworks. Giving them the rest of the day, about 86340 seconds, to do whatever they want to do.

## More

In the future, rewards mechanisms, like a token airdrop could also help with engagement, offering loyal users and artists a way to extract the maximum value for their contributions to our Magical Machine. (yeah, this is alpha for whoever is reading it until the end)
